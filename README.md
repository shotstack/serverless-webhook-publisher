# Serverless Webhook Publisher

### A simple service for publishing and retrying webhook POSTs to a 3rd party callback URL.

Uses AWS Lambda, SQS and the Serverless Framework. A Consumer receives messages from SQS with a payload which it POST's
to a callback URL. If the callback POST fails then the message is requeued with an exponential back-off delay.

-----

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16
- AWS Account

### Serverless Framework

The Serverless Framework is used to deploy the application to AWS Lambda. A local version is installed as a dev 
dependency using NPM. Follow the Serverless AWS credentials
[setup guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials) to ensure access to AWS is
configured correctly.

### Add AWS Account ID

The [serverless.yaml](serverless.yaml) file needs to know your 12 digit [AWS Account ID]
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html#FindingYourAWSId).

Copy the `.env.dist` file and rename it to `.env`

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

Edit the .env file and insert your AWS ID next to `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=`

### Modify header name

The POST callback uses a custom headers which can be prefixed with your project or service name. Just edit the 
.env file and change `HEADER_NAME`

### Add deployment bucket prefix

A deployment bucket centralizes all your Serverless deployments in to a single bucket in S3 rather than creating a new
bucket for each Serverless project and each environment. Make sure the bucket exists, create it if it does not. The
deployment will append the region to the bucket prefix. Edit the .env file and change `DEPLOY_BUCKET_PREFIX`.

### Install dependencies

Install project dependencies including a local installation of the Serverless Framework

```
npm install
```

### Deploy

Deploys to the `dev` environment by default.

```
npm run deploy
```

To deploy to a particular staging environment:

```
npm run deploy -- --stage [dev|stage|v1]
```

Note: the deployment uses the 
[serverless-stage-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-stage-manager) 
to restrict the environments that can be created. Also the 
[serverless-prune-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-prune-plugin) 
is used to prune old versions of Lambda functions. Edit or remove these in the 
**serverless.yaml** file to suit your deployment and environment requirements.

## How it works

### Worker/Consumer ([src/worker.js](src/worker.js))

The worker is a Lambda function that listens for messages in an SQS queue.

When a message is received it will try to post the message payload to the provided 
callback URL. If it fails if fails it attempts to requeue the message with a delay 
until the maximum amount of retries is exceeded.

### Subscriber ([src/subscriber.js](src/subscriber.js))

The subscriber is provided as an example only. The subscriber receives the POSTed 
callback data and does something with it (i.e. update a database based on a value 
in the payload. The subscriber should be an external system somewhere on the 
internet.

A `MOCK_SUBSCRIBER_RESPONSE_CODE` environment variable is available that can be 
edited in the Lambda console to test requeueing or success (i.e. set to 200 for
success or 500 to requeue).

### Publishing Messages

Your application would usually publish a message to SQS after it has completed a 
long running process, process or status change (i.e. after completing a video 
render task). For testing you can follow the 
[AWS SQS message sending guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-send-message.html) 
to send a message via the AWS Console.

The message should be JSON formatted with the following schema:

**payload:** The main body/data that you want your application to POST to the subscriber.

**url:** The subscriber callback URL that data will be POSTed to.

**eventType:** An optional event type that will be sent as an `X-Shotstack-Event-Type` to the subscriber.

**attempt:** Allows the retry mechanism to keep track of the number of retries it has processed. Defaults to `1` if omitted.

#### Example:
```
{
    "payload": {
        "id": "a6d44d83-a065-4154-b421-4759acd6d4df",
        "status": "complete"
    },
    "url": "https://apigid.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/mock-subscriber",
    "eventType": "render",
    "attempt": 1
}
```

## Requeueing

If the worker receives a response error code outside the 200-399 range the 
message will be requeued.

An exponential back-off is used to avoid placing a burden on the server 
receiving the webhook callback. By default the worker will try to requeue 
the message 10 times with a back-off exponent of 3.

The retries will be as follows:

| Attempt | Back-off (sec) | Back-off (min) | Cumulative (sec) | Cumulative (min)
|---|---|---|---|---
| 1 | - | - | 0 | 0
| 2 | 8 | 0:08 | 8 | 0:08
| 3 | 27 | 0:27 | 35 | 0:35
| 4 | 64 | 1:04 | 99 | 1:39
| 5 | 125 | 2:05 | 224 | 3:44
| 6 | 216 | 3:36 | 440 | 7:20
| 7 | 343 | 5:43 | 783 | 13:03
| 8 | 512 | 8:32 | 1295 | 21:35
| 9 | 729 | 12:09 | 2024 | 33:44
| 10 | 900 | 15:00 | 2924 | 48:44

The number of retries and exponent can be adjusted in the worker file. Note that 
SQS has a maximum delivery delay of 900 seconds (15 minutes).
